# -Sound-Signal-based-Respiratory-Disease-Classification


In our project, we aim to use technology to help
detect respiratory diseases early, making healthcare easier to
access and more efficient. We have collected 920 sound recordings
in WAV format that capture the sounds of breathing and
coughing. To start, we are building a smart model using a
technique called Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). This model will
analyze the sound recordings and determine if they show signs
of respiratory diseases like asthma or pneumonia. Our goal
is to offer doctors and patients a quick and accurate way to
identify potential health issues. But we’re not stopping there. We
understand how important it is to identify specific respiratory
sounds like crackles and wheezes. To do this, we are testing four
different methods: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)and
GRU. We want to find the best method for this task. To make our
solution easy to use for everyone, we are creating a user-friendly
app using the Flutter framework. With this app, anyone can
record a sound, and the system will quickly tell if it’s normal or
indicates a respiratory problem. It will also provide insights
into which disease might be responsible.
